# NextJS + Ant.Design

This repo is a starter kit to a NextJS project with Ant.Design components
library. Typescript is enabled.

-   [NextJS][nextjs] is a React-based framework with a handful of sweet stuff,
    like server-side rendering, file-based routing and easy deploy with [Zeit
    Now][zeitnow].
-   [Ant.Design][antd] is a components library for React (also implemented for
    other frameworks). Version 3.x (current) is used for this kit.
-   Typescript integration comes with the latest NextJS.

Known issue for ant.design is the huge Icons bundle size. I have no idea how to
solve this short of waiting for v4.x release, in which they promised to fix
this.
